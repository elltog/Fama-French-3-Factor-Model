# Fama-French-3-Factor-Model

This project looks at how a U.S. mutual fund actually performed, using the Fama French Three Factor Model and comparing it with CAPM. I pulled daily price data from Yahoo Finance, converted them into monthly returns, and ran regressions to see how much of the fund's performance can be explained by market movements, company size, and value factors.
